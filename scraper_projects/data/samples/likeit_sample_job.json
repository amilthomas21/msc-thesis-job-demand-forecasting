    "description": "At Trodo, we recognized a gap in the online marketplace back in 2013 - while it was easy to buy almost anything on the internet, car parts and spares were still elusive. From our very first day, our mission was to provide a user-friendly online service that prioritized the customer experience above all else. Not only did we achieve that goal, but we also revolutionized the e-commerce landscape for car parts and spares, paving the way for other businesses to follow suit.",
